Spirals! The Triangulum Galaxy, seen here, is a spiral galaxy about 3 
million light years from Earth belonging to the group of galaxies
that includes the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies.
Chandra X-Ray Observatory's (@NASAChandraXRay) data in pink reveals a diverse
range of objects including neutron stars and black holes that are pulling material 
from a companion star, and supernova remnants. 
An optical image from amateur astronomer Warren Keller in red, green, 
and blue shows the majestic 
arms of this spiral galaxy that in many ways is a cousin to our own Milky Way.
